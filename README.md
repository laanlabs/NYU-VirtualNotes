# NYU-VirtualNotes

This project uses RealityKit and Reality Composer to make virtual notes for a printer. 

 Currently this project attaches to a horizontal plane, but will work on having it recognize and attach to an object using apple's ARObjectAnchor [Sample Project that can create .arobject files](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/content_anchors/scanning_and_detecting_3d_objects)
